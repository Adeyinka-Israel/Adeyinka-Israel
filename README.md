# Hello! I am Adeyinka Adebowale

I am Data Analyst | Data Analyst Instructor / Mentor 
___________________________________________________________________________

### About Me :

I hold a **Diploma in Data Analytics** and am currently pursuing a **Data Science degree at WorldQuant University**.

My journey into data began with a natural love for numbers and problem-solving. Over time, this grew into a strong passion for extracting meaning from data, identifying patterns, and solving real-world problems with insights.

Iâ€™ve had the opportunity to **teach and mentor several aspiring data professionals**, which has further deepened my understanding and love for the field.
With hands-on experience in tools and technologies like:

- **Excel**
- **Power BI**
- **SQL**
- **NoSQL (MongoDB)**
- **Python**

I enjoy turning messy datasets into clean, actionable stories. Whether itâ€™s through dashboards, reports, or code, I believe in the power of data to drive smart decisions.
Iâ€™m continuously **learning, building, and collaborating** â€” because for me, data isnâ€™t just a career path, itâ€™s a language I love speaking.
